        <b>Foolscap is a new kind of convention.</b> We bring together writers, artists, fans,
        thinkers and makers to create a weekend-long conversation about the things that excite 
        us. Everyone is interesting at Foolscap. By bringing together a community of diverse 
        interests and experiences, we make a space where we all learn from each other.
